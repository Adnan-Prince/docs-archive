# Xamarin Docs Archive
 
## Recipes

The conceptual guides at [docs.microsoft.com/xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin) are longer articles that cover various topics in depth, they explain the _why_ as well as the _how_. In contrast, recipes in this archive tend to be much shorter. They usually only explain the _how_, through a mixture of step-by-step points, screenshots, and code blocks. The recipes have not been kept up-to-date, and occasionally will use features or APIs that have changed or been deprecated. Check the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin) for the latest information.
